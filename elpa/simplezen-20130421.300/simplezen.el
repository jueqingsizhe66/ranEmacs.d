;;; Commentary:

;; A simple subset of zencoding-mode for Emacs.

;; It completes these types:
;;
;;     div        --> <div></div>
;;     input      --> <input>
;;     .article   --> <div class="article"></div>
;;     #logo      --> <div id="logo"></div>
;;     ul.items   --> <ul class="items"></ul>
;;     h2#tagline --> <h2 id="tagline"></h2>
;;
;; So why not just use zencoding-mode for a much richer set of features?
;;
;; - this covers 98% of my usage of zencoding-mode
;; - this is simple enough to be predictable
;;
;; The original had a way of surprising me. Like when I just wanted to
;; add a quick <code></code> tag inside some prose, and it garbled the
;; entire sentence. That doesn't happen here, since this subset does not
;; look past whitespace.
;;
;; It also will not try to expand anything that is not a known html-tag,
;; reducing the number of errors when I just want to indent the line.
;; Yes, I have it on TAB.
;;
;; ## Setup
;;
;; You can bind `simplezen-expand` to any button of your choosing.
;;
;;     (require 'simplezen)
;;     (define-key html-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-z") 'simplezen-expand)
;;
;; If you want it bound to `tab` you can do this:
;;
;;     (define-key html-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'simplezen-expand-or-indent-for-tab)
;;
;; Then it will still indent the line, except in cases where you're
;; looking back at a valid simplezen-expression (see above).
;;
;; To get it working with yasnippet aswell, I did this:
;;
;;     (defun --setup-simplezen ()
;;       (set (make-local-variable 'yas/fallback-behavior)
;;            '(apply simplezen-expand-or-indent-for-tab)))
;;
;;     (add-hook 'sgml-mode-hook '--setup-simplezen)
;;
;; Which will give yasnippet first priority, then simplezen gets it
;; chance, and if neither of those did anything it will indent the line.
