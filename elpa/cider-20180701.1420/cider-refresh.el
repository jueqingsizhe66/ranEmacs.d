some classes of error (for example, those caused by circular dependencies)
that a normal reload would not otherwise recover from.  The trade-off of
clearing is that stale code from any deleted files may not be completely
unloaded.

refresh functions (defined in `cider-refresh-before-fn' and
`cider-refresh-after-fn') from being invoked."
