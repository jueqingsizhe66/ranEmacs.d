;;; Commentary:
;;
;; fringe-current-line is a package to indicate current line on the fringe.
;; You can use by the following steps.
;;
;; 1. Place this file on your load-path.
;;
;; 2. Add the following code into your init file:
;;
;;   (require 'fringe-current-line)
;;
;; 3. Activate the mode.
;;
;; * To enable it only in certain buffer, run `M-x fringe-current-line-mode'.
;;   Run again and you can disable it.
;;
;; * To enable it globally, add the following into your init file:
;;
;;     (global-fringe-current-line-mode 1)
;;
;;   You can toggle it by running `M-x global-fringe-current-line-mode'.
;;
;;
;; ## Limitation
;;
;; The indicator is not shown if the cursor is at the end of the buffer and the last line is empty.
;;
;;; Code:

(defvar fcl-fringe-bitmap 'vertical-bar
  "Bitmap to indicate current line.")

;;; internal variable
(defvar fcl-fringe-overlay nil
  "Hold an overlay for the fringe bitmap.")
(make-variable-buffer-local 'fcl-fringe-overlay)

(defun fcl-display-fringe-bitmap-at-current-line ()
  (let ((s "x")
        (point (point)))
    (fcl-clear-fringe-bitmap)
    ;; Somehow the cursor disappears at the end of the buffer if the last line is empty.
    ;; So don't display the bitmap on the fringe in that case.
    (unless (and (eobp) (bolp))
      (setq fcl-fringe-overlay (make-overlay point (1+ point)))
      (put-text-property 0 1 'display (list 'left-fringe fcl-fringe-bitmap) s)
      (overlay-put fcl-fringe-overlay 'before-string s))))

(defun fcl-clear-fringe-bitmap ()
  (when fcl-fringe-overlay
    (delete-overlay fcl-fringe-overlay)
    (setq fcl-fringe-overlay nil)))

(defun fringe-current-line-mode-on ()
  (add-hook 'pre-command-hook 'fcl-clear-fringe-bitmap)
  (add-hook 'post-command-hook 'fcl-display-fringe-bitmap-at-current-line nil t)
  )

(defun fringe-current-line-mode-off ()
  (fcl-clear-fringe-bitmap)
  (remove-hook 'pre-command-hook 'fcl-clear-fringe-bitmap t)
  (remove-hook 'post-command-hook 'fcl-display-fringe-bitmap-at-current-line t)
  )

(define-minor-mode fringe-current-line-mode
  "Indicate current line on the fringe."
  :global nil
  (if fringe-current-line-mode
      (fringe-current-line-mode-on)
    (fringe-current-line-mode-off)))

(define-global-minor-mode global-fringe-current-line-mode
  fringe-current-line-mode
  (lambda ()
    (unless (minibufferp)
