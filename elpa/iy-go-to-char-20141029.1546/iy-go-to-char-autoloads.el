occurence of CHAR.

Typing \\[iy-go-to-char-quit] will quit and return to the
original point.

Typing \\[iy-go-to-char-isearch] or
\\[iy-go-to-char-isearch-backward]] will start `isearch` using
CHAR.

Typing \\[iy-go-to-char-kill-region] or
\\[iy-go-to-char-kill-ring-save] will kill/copy between current
point and the start point.
