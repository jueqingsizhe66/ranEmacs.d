This is news.info, produced by makeinfo version 6.1 from news.texi.

Changes and New Features in development version:

   * This is the last release to support Emacs older than 25.1 Going
     forward, only GNU Emacs 25.1 and newer will be supported.  Soon
     after this release, support for older Emacs versions will be
     dropped from the git master branch.  Note that MELPA uses the git
     master branch to produce ESS snapshots, so if you are using Emacs <
     25.1 from MELPA and are unable to upgrade, you should switch to
     MELPA-stable.

   * ESS[R]: Long + + prompts in the inferior no longer offset output.
     New option 'strip' for 'inferior-ess-replace-long+' strips the
     entire + + sequence.

   * ESS[R]: Fontification of roxygen '@param' keywords now supports
     comma-separated parameters.

   * ESS[R]: Function-like keywords such as 'if ()' or 'stop()' are no
     longer fontified as keyword if not followed by an opening
     parenthesis.  The same holds for search path modifiers like
     'library()' or 'require()'.  This feature is only available in
     Emacs >= 25.

   * ESS[R]: We have improved fontification of keywords so they better
     reflect the semantics of the R language.  'ess-R-keywords' now only
     contains words reserved by the R parser.
     'ess-R-control-flow-keywords' contains words of base functions that
     cause non-contiguous control flow, such as 'return()' and 'stop()'.
     It includes the following variables that were previously not
     fontified: 'on.exit()', 'tryCatch()', 'withRestarts()',
     'invokeRestart()', 'recover()' and 'browser()'

     Finally, 'ess-R-signal-keywords' contains functions part of the
     condition system that only potentially impact control flow:
     'message()', 'warning()' (moved from 'ess-R-keywords'),
     'signalCondition()' and 'withCallingHandlers()'.  These keywords
     inherit from 'ess-modifiers-face' (the face used for 'library()'
     etc).

   * ESS modes now inherit from 'prog-mode'.

   * ESS[R]: The package development minor mode now only activates
     within editing buffers by default, i.e.  ones that inherit from
     'prog-mode' or 'text-mode'.  If you want to restore the old
     behaviour and activate the package mode in all buffers (that have a
     'default-directory' that is part of a package path), set
     'ess-r-package-auto-activate' to 't'.

   * ESS now provides support for flymake in R buffers for Emacs 26 and
     newer.  Users need to install the 'lintr' package (available on
     CRAN) to use it.  Customizable options include 'ess-use-flymake',
     'ess-r-flymake-linters', and 'ess-r-flymake-lintr-cache'.

   * Improved customization for faces.  ESS now provides custom faces
     for (nearly) all faces used and places face customization options
     into their own group.  Users can customize these options using 'M-x
     customize-group RET ess-faces'.

   * ESS[R]: Gained support for xref in Emacs 25+.  *Note (emacs)Xref::

   * ESS[R]: Changing the working directory is now always reflected in
     the process buffer.

   * ESS[R]: The startup screen has been cleaned up and displays the
     startup directory with an explicit 'setwd()'.

   * ESS now displays the language dialect in the mode-line So, for
     example, R buffers will now show ESS[R] rather than ESS[S].

   * The ESS manual has been updated and revised.

   * ESS[R]: 'Makevars' files are now automatically opened with
     'makefile-mode'.

   * New varaible 'ess-write-to-dribble'.  This allows users to disable
     the dribble ('*ESS*') buffer if they wish.

   * ESS now respects Emacs conventions for keybindings.  This means
     that The 'C-c [letter]' bindings have been removed.  This affects
     'C-c h', which was bound to 'ess-eval-line-and-step-invisibly' in
     'sas-mode-local-map'; 'C-c f', which was bound to
     'ess-insert-function-outline' in 'ess-add-MM-keys'; and 'C-c h',
     which was bound to 'ess-handy-commands' in 'Rd-mode-map',
     'ess-noweb-minor-mode-map', and 'ess-help-mode-map'

   * prettify-symbols-mode no longer breaks indentation This is
     accomplished by having the pretty symbols occupy the same number of
     characters as their non-pretty cousins.  You may customize the new
     variable 'ess-r-prettify-symbols' to control this behavior.

   * Variable 'ess-s-versions-list' is obsolete and ignored.  Use
     'ess-s-versions' instead.  You may pass arguments by starting the
     inferior process with the universal argument.

   * The 'ess-r-args.el' library has obsoleted and will be removed in a
     future release.  Use 'eldoc-mode' instead, which is on by default.

   * All of the '*-program-name' variables have been renamed to
     '*-program'.  Users who previously customized e.g.
     'inferior-ess-R-program-name' will need to update their
     customization to 'inferior-ess-R-program'.  These variables are
     treated as risky variables.

   * 'ess-smart-S-assign' changed name to 'ess-insert-S-assign'.  By
     default, it provides similar functionality.  Since many users
     dislike this functionality, it is easier to disable; set
     'ess-smart-S-assign-key' to nil.  The following functions have been
     made obsolete and will be removed in the next release of ESS:
     ess-smart-S-assign, ess-toggle-S-assign, ess-toggle-S-assign-key,
     ess-disable-smart-S-assign.

   * The option ess-S-assign has been removed.  Customize new option
     'ess-assign-list' instead.

   * 'C-c C-=' is now bound to 'ess-cycle-assignment' by default See the
     docstring for details.  New user customization option
     'ess-assign-list' controls what assignment operators are cycled
     through.

   Changes and New Features in 17.11:

   * The ESS initialisation process has been streamlined.  You can now
     load the R and Stata modes independently from the rest of ESS. Just
     put '(require 'ess-r-mode)' or '(require 'ess-stata-mode)' in your
     init file.  This is for experienced Emacs users as this requires
     setting up autoloads for '.R' files manually.  We will keep
     maintaining 'ess-site' for easy loading of all ESS features.

   * Reloading and quitting the process is now more robust.  If no
     process is attached, ESS now switches automatically to one
     (prompting you for selection if there are several running).
     Reloading and quitting will now work during a debug session or when
     R is prompting for input (for instance after a crash).  Finally,
     the window configuration is saved and restored after reloading to
     prevent the buffer of the new process from capturing the cursor.

   * ESS[R]: New command 'ess-r-package-use-dir'.  It sets the working
     directory of the current process to the current package directory.

   * ESS[R] Lookup for references in inferior buffers has been improved.
     New variable 'ess-r-package-source-roots' contains package
     sub-directories which are searched recursively during the file
     lookup point.  Directories in 'ess-tracebug-search-path' are now
     also searched recursively.

   * ESS[R] Namespaced evaluation is now automatically enabled only in
     the 'R/' directory.  This way ESS will not attempt to update
     function definitions from a package if you are working from e.g.  a
     test file.

   Changes and New Features in 16.10:

   * ESS[R]: Syntax highlighting is now more consistent.  Backquoted
     names are not fontified as strings (since they really are
     identifiers).  Furthermore they are now correctly recognised when
     they are function definitions or function calls.
   * ESS[R]: Backquoted names and '%op%' operators are recognised as
     sexp.  This is useful for code navigation, e.g.  with 'C-M-f' and
     'C-M-b'.
   * ESS[R]: Integration of outline mode with roxygen examples fields.
     You can use outline mode's code folding commands to fold the
     examples field.  This is especially nice to use with well
     documented packages with long examples set.  Set
     'ess-roxy-fold-examples' to non-nil to automatically fold the
     examples field when you open a buffer.
   * ESS[R]: New experimental feature: syntax highlighting in roxygen
     examples fields.  This is turned off by default.  Set
     'ess-roxy-fontify-examples' to non-nil to try it out.
   * ESS[R]: New package development command 'ess-r-devtools-ask' bound
     to 'C-c C-w C-a'.  It asks with completion for any devtools command
     that takes 'pkg' as argument.
   * ESS[R]: New command 'C-c C-e C-r' to reload the inferior process.
     Currently only implemented for R. The R method runs
     'inferior-ess-r-reload-hook' on reloading.
   * ESS[R]: 'ess-r-package-mode' is now activated in non-file buffers
     as well.

   Bug fixes in 16.10:
   * ESS[R]: Fix broken (un)flagging for debugging inside packages
   * ESS[R]: Fixes (and improvements) in Package development
   * ESS[R]: Completion no longer produces '...=' inside 'list( )'.
   * ESS[R]: Better debugging and tracing in packages.
   * ESS[R]: Better detection of symbols at point.
   * ESS[R]: No more spurious warnings on deletion of temporary files.
   * ESS[julia]: help and completion work (better)
   * ESS[julia]: available via 'ess-remote'

   Changes and New Features in 16.04:

   * ESS[R]: 'developer' functionality has been refactored.  The new
     user interface consists of a single command
     'ess-r-set-evaluation-env' bound by default to 'C-c C-t C-s'.  Once
     an evaluation environment has been set with, all subsequent ESS
     evaluation will source the code into that environment.  By default,
     for file within R packages the evaluation environment is set to the
     package environment.  Set 'ess-r-package-auto-set-evaluation-env'
     to 'nil' to disable this.
   * ESS[R]: New 'ess-r-package-mode' This development mode provides
     features to make package development easier.  Currently, most of
     the commands are based on the 'devtools' packages and are
     accessible with 'C-c C-w' prefix.  See the documentation of
     'ess-r-package-mode' function for all available commands.  With
     'C-u' prefix each command asks for extra arguments to the
     underlying devtools function.  This mode is automatically enabled
     in all files within R packages and is indicated with '[pkg:NAME]'
     in the mode-line.
   * ESS[R]: Help lookup has been improved.  It is now possible to get
     help for namespaced objects such as pkg::foobar.  Furthermore, ESS
     recognizes more reliably when you change 'options('html_type')'.
   * ESS[R]: New specialized breakpoints for debugging magrittr pipes
   * ESS: ESS now implements a simple message passing interface to
     communicate between ESS and inferior process.

   Bug fixes in 16.04:
   * ESS[R]: Roxygen blocks with backtics are now correctly filled
   * ESS[R]: Don't skip breakpoints in magrittr's 'debug_pipe'
   * ESS[R]: Error highlighting now understands 'testthat' type errors
   * ESS[Julia]: Added getwd and setwd generic commands
