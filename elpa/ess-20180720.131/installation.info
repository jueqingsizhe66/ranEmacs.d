1 Packaged ESS
--------------

You may install ESS from Emacs by using 'M-x package-install' if you add
the third-party package archive MELPA to 'package-archives'.
Instructions on how to do so are found on MELPA's website
(https://melpa.org/).  MELPA also hosts MELPA-stable with stable ESS
builds.  You may choose between MELPA with the latest and greatest
features (and bugs) or MELPA-stable, which may lag a bit behind but
should be more stable.

   Alternatively, many GNU/Linux distributions package and distribute
ESS, check with your distribution to see if this is the case.  You may
need to add the above require statement to your configuration file in
order to activate ESS.

   You will need to add

     (require 'ess-site)

to your Emacs configuration file in order to activate ESS. Advanced
users may activate only a particular language by loading '(require
'ess-r-mode)' instead.

   Users of the nonfree operating systems macOS and Windows may be

2 From source
-------------

Users who wish to install ESS from the source code may follow these
instructions:

  1. Obtain the ESS source files.

     *Note (ESS)Latest Version::

     We will refer to the location of the ESS source files as
     '/path/to/ESS/' hereafter.

  2. Optionally, compile elisp files and build the documentation:
          cd /path/to/ESS/
          make
     Without this step, info, pdf and html documentation and reference
     card will not be available.  Uncompiled ESS will also run slower.

  3. Optionally, install site-wide:

     You may make ESS available to all users of a machine by installing
     it site-wide.  To do so, run 'make install'.  You might need
     administrative privileges:

          make install

     The files are installed into '/usr/share/emacs' directory.  For
     this step to run correctly on macOS, you will need to adjust the
     'PREFIX' path in 'Makeconf'.  The necessary code and instructions
     are commented in that file.

  4. Initialize ESS

     If you have performed the 'make install' step from above, add:

          (require 'ess-site)

     to your Emacs configuration file.  Otherwise, you should add
     '/path/to/ESS/lisp/' to your Emacs load path and then load ESS with
     the following lines in your Emacs configuration file:

          (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ESS/lisp/")
          (require 'ess-site)

     ess-site.el loads all ESS languages.  If you only want to load
     support for R, you may use

          (require 'ess-r-mode)

     instead of ess-site.  Note that support for loading only part of
     ESS is recommended only for experienced Emacs users.

  5. Check installation Restart your Emacs and check that ESS was loaded
     from a correct location with 'M-x ess-version'.
