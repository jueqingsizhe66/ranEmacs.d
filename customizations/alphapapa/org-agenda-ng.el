;;; Commentary:

;; This is just a proof-of-concept for how the agenda code might be
;; written in a more functional way, to avoid making multiple passes
;; through each file when building a multi-day agenda.

;; It also functions as a kind of "query language" for Org buffers.

;;;; Principles

;;;;; Try to imitate traditional Org agenda code's results and methods

;; The traditional agenda code is complicated, but well-optimized.  We should imitate it where
;; possible.  We should also attempt to return the same results as the traditional agenda code
;; (ultimately, that is; but whether we reach that level of complexity depends on, e.g. performance
;; achieved, whether it looks like a feasible alternative, etc).  At the least, we should return
;; results in the same format, so they can be used by other code that uses agenda output
;; (e.g. org-agenda-finalize-entries, org-agenda-finalize, org-super-agenda, etc).  Of course, this
;; goal does not necessarily apply to the "query language"-like features, and ideally the
;; agenda-like features should build upon those.

;;;;; Preserve the call to =org-agenda-finalize-entries=

;; We want to preserve the final call to org-agenda-finalize-entries to preserve compatibility
;; with other packages and functions.

;;; Code:

(require 'org)
(require 'org-agenda)
(require 'dash)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'seq)

(require 'org-ql)
