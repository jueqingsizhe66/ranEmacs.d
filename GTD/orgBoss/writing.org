番茄时间的本质，是充当时间度量。
用来表示今天一天的工作，用了几个番茄时间，明天能否多工作一个番茄时间来减少无意义的消磨。
在具体项目上，例如：上次写一篇文章用了3个番茄时间，这次能不能提高效率，争取2个番茄时间。
这也就是为什么番茄时间反复强调必须25分钟，且中间不能打断的原因。

    我写“入门书”而不是“进阶书”的另外一个原因，就像爱因斯坦说的：
                如果你不能向一个六岁小孩解释清楚一个问题，那么你其实并不真的懂。
  我在大学里见过太多讲不清楚问题的教授，中国的美国的都有，后来我发现那是因为他们自己都没弄明白。没有非常深入的见解，
  你是不可能把深奥的东西解释清楚的。反过来，试图把一个问题向完全不懂的人讲清楚，也会大大加深你自己的理解。
  看了我的『怎样写一个解释器』而学会解释器的人都会明白，
  我的理解程度在全世界处于什么地位。没有成千上万次写各种各样解释器的试验，失败和领悟，你是不可能理解到那种程度的。

    深入理解任何一门学问的关键，不是试图去回答越来越“高级”，越来越复杂的问题，而是试图去回答最基础的问题，
  反复地问自己最基础的问题…… 爱因斯坦之所以能发现相对论，不是因为他去思索看起来高级的难题，而是因为他去思索
  一个最基本的问题：时间是什么？其他人觉得这问题很傻，时间不就是一秒一秒过去的那个东西吗？现在是半夜两点，那就是时间！
  然后这些人就永远没机会发现相对论了。同样的，深入理解计算机科学的关键，不是去学习云计算，大数据或者区块链，
  而是去思索最最基本的问题：“计算是什么？” “程序是什么？” “函数是什么？” “变量是什么？” “抽象是什么？” …… 
  你觉得自己知道这些问题的答案吗？那请你再想一想！

    实际上直到 20 世纪初，全世界没有一个数学家真正的理解“函数是什么？” 这个如此基础的问题。
  这些人却天天都在用“函数”这个词，以至于他们的定理和证明里面出现各种奇怪的错误。
  直到 1904 年 Frege 写了这篇论文“What Is A Function?” 这种情况才得到了改善。数学发展了几千年，
  居然没有人真的理解如此基础的，天天都在用的概念。他们以为自己明白了，所以根本没有仔细思考过它是什么。
  就像我们从来没思考过什么是时间，却天天都在谈论“需要多少时间”一样。

** suggest, input, filter, target(SIFT) 

For this article, I will use terms suggestion and completion to
mean subtly different concepts. I'll also use terms explore and
filter in describing various phases in user interaction.

***  Suggestion
Offer the user some suggestions that help explore the space of choices. (metaphor: avoid the blank sheet of paper syndrome).
***  Completion
Filter the available choices based on user input with the goal of reaching the target as rapidly as possible.
***  Explore
User does not necessarily know what he is looking for, but expects to be able to recognize what he wants from the displayed choices.
***  Target
User knows exactly what he wants, e.g., filename, or function-name, but would still like to get there with the fewest possible number of keystrokes, along with the needed memory aids to guide the decision.


Note that in practice, suggestions and completions work
hand-in-hand, with the visual display playing a central role in
guiding the user through the pace of available choices. In a typical
user interaction session, the space of suggestions gets filtered by
user input to produce the available completions (choices) for the next
round of user input — think of this as a
Suggest/Input/Filter/Target (SIFT) interaction loop. Similarly, explore and
target type activities typically go hand-in-hand, with explore
serving as a memory-aid for locating the target.



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Effective Suggest And Complete In An Eyes-Free Environment
1 Executive Summary
Emacs has always provided a wealth of techniques for rapid keyboard
input (abbrev, dabbrev, hippie-expandand completion come to mind)
alongside a rich collection of tools for navigating among open
buffers. And these affordances have significantly increased over the
last few years with the arrival of packages like ido, company,
helm etc., each replete with different strategies for rapid task
completion such as flex and fuzzy matching. This article investigates
these tools in an eyes-free environment, specifically in the context
of Emacspeak and rapid task completion. I've not investigated every
possible package in this space — instead, I've picked a collection
of packages and techniques that have worked well in an eyes-free
context. Finally, the ultimate metric I use in each case is the time
to successful task completion — since at the end of the day, that's
the only metric that counts when it comes to user productivity.

2 Terminology
For this article, I will use terms suggestion and completion to
mean subtly different concepts. I'll also use terms explore and
filter in describing various phases in user interaction.

Suggestion
Offer the user some suggestions that help explore the space of choices. (metaphor: avoid the blank sheet of paper syndrome).
Completion
Filter the available choices based on user input with the goal of reaching the target as rapidly as possible.
Explore
User does not necessarily know what he is looking for, but expects to be able to recognize what he wants from the displayed choices.
Target
User knows exactly what he wants, e.g., filename, or function-name, but would still like to get there with the fewest possible number of keystrokes, along with the needed memory aids to guide the decision.


Note that in practice, suggestions and completions work
hand-in-hand, with the visual display playing a central role in
guiding the user through the pace of available choices. In a typical
user interaction session, the space of suggestions gets filtered by
user input to produce the available completions (choices) for the next
round of user input — think of this as a
Suggest/Input/Filter/Target (SIFT) interaction loop. Similarly, explore and
target type activities typically go hand-in-hand, with explore
serving as a memory-aid for locating the target.


3 Tasks Where Suggestions And Completions Help Speed Up Task Completion
Here are exemplars of tasks that I perform often and where I require
all the help that Emacs can provide in completing the task as rapidly
as possible:

File Navigation
Navigating to and opening a file — either code or prose.
Content Navigation
Jump to a specific location (section, function, class/method, or pattern-match) in that file.
Buffer Navigation
Jump to an already open buffer in a long-running Emacs.
If that buffer existed — but has since been killed (by
midnight for example), then re-open that buffer.
I do everything in Emacs, so open buffers include a large
number of ORG and LaTeX documents, Web Pages opened in EWW 
(news sites, documentation, blog articles), IM Chats (I use
jabber), Mail Buffers — both open folders and previously
sent messages, and much, much more.
Media
Easily launch media streams including local and streaming media.
EBooks
Open (or jump to an already open) EBook to continue reading.
Code Completion
Complete function/method-name as I type, with an easy affordance to move among the available choices. The Suggest/Input/Filter/Target interaction loop applies here as well.


Notice that as one performs all of these tasks, every target is an
Emacs buffer or Emacs buffer location. In the case of completion, the
target is a string that gets inserted at the current location.

4 Features Of Eyes-Free Interaction
Using spoken output — as opposed to a rich visual display — has
the following special features and/or drawbacks:

A large visual display can offer the user many choices at a time,
and the eye's ability to rapidly scan these choices makes for an
extremely fast Suggest/Input/Filter/Target loop. As an example, an
interface like helm can display a large number of initial
choices, with the user filtering these down with a few strategic key-presses.
Spoken output takes time — and there is simply no way around
this — speeding up speech-rate helps to a point, but speaking
50 choices very fast does not help the user in the explore
phase. This means that effective filtering and ranking of the available
choices takes on added importance.
More importantly, picking a Suggest/Input/Filter/Target (SIFT)
interaction loop that depends on a large display is sub-optimal
for eyes-free interaction.
Given (2,3), smart filtering, flex/fuzzy matching, and ranking
based on past user behavior take on added importance in an
eyes-free environment. As an aside, I have high hopes in this
area for package prescient — though in my few days of usage,
it has yet to make a difference in my productivity.
For many of the tasks enumerated in the previous section, (2, 3
and 4) make ido with flex and fuzzy matching extremely
effective. In contrast, helm with similar flex and fuzzy
matching (via packages helm-flx and helm-fuzzier) adds little
extra benefit — and the fractional extra time to compute and
display the choices can even lead to a minor productivity hit.
When it comes to writing code with completion, package company
has proven extremely effective. Notice that when writing code,
one rarely if ever resorts to fuzzy matching — this may well
be subjective. Speaking for myself, I cannot think of function
or method names in the context of fuzzy matching — said
differently, it's hard to think xl for function-name
next-line — even though in a given filtering context, xl
might define the shortest path through the available choices to
the target next-line. Given this, emacspeak implements a
company front-end that allows the user to navigate through the
available choices with succinct spoken feedback, and I use those
choices only after I have typed sufficiently many characters to
have a manageable number of choices — said differently, though
package company is set up to trigger after 3 characters have
been typed, I usually end up typing more — and often resort to
dabbrev or hippee-expand to input this longer prefix.
Some of the shortcomings with eyes-free interaction enumerated
above lead to my looking for effective work-arounds that might
well work well outside the eyes-free context, e.g. when the
available choices are too large to fit on a typical visual
display. Interestingly, most of these have also been solved by
mainstream Emacs developers in their never-ending/unerring quest for increased
productivity — package ido and company are excellent exemplars.


Mapping Solutions To Tasks

This section maps the various solutions I use to speed up the tasks
enumerated earlier in this article.

4.1 File And Buffer Navigation
I use package ido with add-ons flx-ido and ido-completing-read+
(formerly ido-ubiquitous) as my primary/only solution for this
task. I've dabbled with package helm — primarily via command
helm-mini but have found almost no use-cases where I did better with
helm. I also use command org-switchb to quickly jump to any of my
open org buffers – since that automatically filters the choices
down for me — I can then get to the org-mode buffer I want with
one or two keystrokes. Notice that in all of these cases, I'm relying
on the fact that I mostly know what I want, i.e., the explore phase
does not start with an entirely blank sheet of paper.

4.2 Content Navigation
Incremental search is your biggest and most effective friend in
effective eyes-free interaction — this simply cannot be stressed
enough. That everything in Emacs is searchable via
incremental-search is a big win for eyes-free interaction. When you
have a large visual display, the human eye is the search interface of
first resort – you typically use a search-command only if the
target is below the fold or far away from the cursor. Because spoken
output takes time, I use isearch even when the target is one or two
lines away.

Structured navigation comes next in my toolbox for navigating content
— imenu for code, and section navigation for documents (org,
LaTeX). I also use command occur to advantage since that provides a
quick way of finding all the desired targets in a document. Given that
program source-code uses indentation for displaying structure,
hbuilt-in command selective-display remains one of Emacs' hidden
treasures with respect to expanding/collapsing source-code.

Finally, I
use a combination of isearch and structured navigation in
org-mode buffres by collapsing the document, and then using
isearch to reveal the desired content fragment.
In the case of LaTeX documents, I use package reftex to
generate a navigation buffer that functions as an interactive table
of contents. 

4.3 Locating And Playing Media
I keep all my music content organized under ~/mp3.
I keep playlist files that contain stream-links to my favorite
Internet streams under emacspeak/media.
The afore-mentioned techniques using ido enables me to launch
local and streaming media with a small number of keystrokes. Once
selected, the content is played via package emacspeak-m-player
which provides Emacs bindings to all mplayer functionality
via that program's slave-mode. In addition, Emacspeak also
implements a smart emacspeak-m-player-locate-media which uses
Emacs' integration with command locate to turn the located
files matching a given pattern into an interactive play-list.

4.4 EBooks
Jumping to already open ebooks is no different than buffer
navigation. I organize all my ebooks under a single directory
tree, and module emacspeak-epub implements a bookshelf that
allows me to organize and browse my collection along various
axies. Finally, Emacspeak implements a light-weight bookmark
facility that works with eww so that I can save my place in an
ebook across Emacs sessions.

4.5 Code Completion
As covered earlier, I use company along with dabbrev and
hippee-expand while writing code. I also use yasnippet to
generate skeleton code. I use auto-correct-mode to
automatically correct repeated errors, and add abbrevs for
commonly occurring typos. 

5 Summary
Emacs' Suggest/Input/Filter/Target (SIFT) interaction loop is just as
effective in eyes-free interaction — in fact more so .
Fuzzy matching when filtering is a big win when working with spoken
output — it leads to faster task completion.
Navigating ones computing environment based on the underlying
structure and semantics of electronic content is a major win —
both when working with a visual or spoken display. The advantages
just become evident far sooner in the eyes-free context due to the
inherently temporal nature of spoken interaction.

** old school and modern feature                                 :emacslisp:

James Gill has a nice tweet about the community of Emacs users:

    I’ve never encountered a community like that of #Emacs users. So many with 10, 20, 30+ years using the tool,
    endless resources and helpful people.
    And so delightfully ‘old school’ and modern at the same time.

An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age.

— James Gill (@IamJamesGill) August 21, 2018

Like most of you, I belong to several tech communities. Not all of them have as nice a reputation.
 The Lisp community, for example, can be notoriously hostile to n00bs.
 A lot of that is residual grumpiness about the fact that the first thing many n00bs do when 
they arrive is suggest some scheme for doing away with parentheses.
 If you heard that as often as the typical Lisper, you’d be grumpy too.

Still, there’s no denying that the Emacs community is exceptionally welcoming to n00bs and that,
 as Gill says, we have a lot of people with extensive experience who are willing to help n00bs as well as more seasoned users.
 We also have folks like Mike Zamansky, Sacha Chua, and Rainer König who spend hours of their own time 
making instructional videos and doing other chores that benefit us all.

I think Gill has it exactly right: We’re old school and modern at the same time.
 Old school because we’re employing an editor that’s older than many of its users 
and modern because that same tool is more powerful and adaptable than its more “modern” competitors.
 In any event, it’s a great community and I’m proud to be a member.

合作的魅力
*** 不能分享就无法协作 

说到协作，你必然已经很赞成。但是无论体制外宣称要建立生态链，还是体制内高喊牵引分系统，往往还是关起门来当个自给自足的农民，内心的梦想还是想当个土皇上。 

有本事的打天下，把自己的围墙盖到别人的领域里。我们普通人就插个篱笆，保护好自己的一亩三分地。 

协作的好处不常见，协作的风险却无法回避。 

我们说最好的产品，每个系统应当由最优秀的人去做。但是你敢吗？你敢将产品的创意与别人分享吗？你敢让更优秀的人与你竞争吗？ 

经验告诉我们，如果你敢将创意告诉别人，别人会毫不客气地署上他的名字，连个谢谢都不会给你。 

环顾四周，不能与同行分享，怕同行剽窃；不能告诉客户，怕客户泄露给对手；也不能告诉盟友和朋友，在利益的诱惑下，盟友马上变对手，朋友立即变敌人。

你只能在保护的围墙里，扩大自己的队伍，用自家很差的能力，去实现无论如何都不能与别人分享的创意。 

作为企业，所有的研究都要自己做，用自家末流的仿真与末流的实验支持二流的设计，梦想实现一流的创意。作为科研者，即使隔壁就是某专业的大拿，也要自己做，不能敲开隔壁的门求别人。 

我们往往过高估计了创意被剽窃的风险，远远低估了无法分享带来的损失。

 

 

*** 将创意变成公知

也许可以这么做，公开你的创意，把创意告诉同行，告诉客户，告诉对手。快速让所有人知道，谁第一个提出了这个创意。

有100家知道了你的创意，就没人敢谎称是他的原创，这就叫用事实占据正统性。

将自己的创意变成公知，也许是对原创最安全的保护。 

申报专利和版权可以保护一些东西，但是不够。 

最不可取的，就是有选择地告诉个别盟友，叮嘱千万不要告诉别人。你会发现利益面前没有好人。要么谁也不告诉，要么告诉所有人，没有中间道路。 



你的创意被大家知道了，虽然你占据了原创的光荣，但是所有人都成为了竞争对手。 

大家站到了同一个起跑线上，看谁可以最快将创意变成产品。如果你能力不如别人，最后还会输给别人。 

将创意告诉大家，就要接受这个结果。你赌的是你对创意理解最深刻，你对创意最执着，你敢于将竞争的压力变为动力。 

逼迫你与最优秀的团队合作，逼迫你高效率地运行，逼迫你接受批评，逼迫你尊重技术，逼迫你玩命地做到最好，这能说是坏事吗？ 

好创意就应当由好队伍去实现，难道你有了好创意，就有资格让不咋地的队伍去浪费吗？ 

把创意藏在怀里，悄悄自己捅咕，没有最强大的竞争力逼迫你做到极致，没有最优秀的人才与你协作，再好的创意将来也会被别人不咋地的创意超越。 

要对得起好创意，就去呼唤强大的力量与自己竞争，把自己逼迫到拼命的绝境。 

 

 

*** 在竞争中协作

协作是必须的，但是协作还必须竞争，要让整个协作过程就是互相淘汰的过程。 

千万不要一开始上来就分蛋糕，把将来的利益划分得清清楚楚。好像可以避免以后打架，其实将来真的蛋糕出来了，该打架还会打架，但是过程中却失去了互相淘汰的激励。 

优秀的协作者，最初是找到的，后期却是逼出来的。给对方找个虚拟的对手，就能保证对方的积极性。 人性靠不住，最初找个好人家合作，只是减少了后期变卦的风险，给对方找个虚拟对手才是保证协作愉快的良方。

优秀的协作者，最初是谈出来的，后期是培养出来的。谈判桌上的利益终归有限，我多了对方就少了，对方多了我就少了，永远不公平。 

如果让大家说各自贡献了百分之几，再把所有的贡献加起来，肯定大于百分之一百，也许会高达百分之二百、三百甚至一千。人们自恋的程度，会让你大跌眼镜，这个与道德无关，这是人性。 

解决这个问题不是没完没了地谈判，谈判会把大家的注意力，从创造更大的价值，转到争夺更多的利益。

*** 把成果放大一百倍 

协作的出路，是为协作者培养更大的新蛋糕，让所有的成果分成几份后越分越多。 

几家协作，在最后产品利益之外，还可以获得各自的利益：
材料加工—获得实验数据验证材料特性
实验分析—获得新材料做实验
仿真分析—获得实验数据验证仿真
理论分析—获得实验与仿真的数据
产品设计—获得理论依据与数据支持 

将研究成果共享，所有人从中获利，一份研究成果，不同的专业获得不同的效益，比如提高测量技术、形成仿真软件、申报专业研究项目、建立专业知名度，从中派生出种种成果。而且交叉研究更容易有突破性的发现。 

大家从划分最终产品利益的小圈子，发展到各家打造新蛋糕。逐步培养出来更强大的协作者和更大的利益圈子。 

前方有大协作的多重利益，后面有虚拟对手的威胁，协作可成。
** 对自己要求高，对别人要求低 
很多人活得不开心，都是因为对自己要求低，对别人要求高，其实要是反过来就很好！

对自己要求高，对别人要求低，活得就舒心了
