  A large-Eddy Simulation of Wind-Plant Aerodynamic

  Increasing that knowledge would allow operators to more effectively run their plants and help developers to
  better site turbines within wind plants to increase efficiency and mitigate loads. It would enable researchers to
  create better turbine- and wind plant-level control systems. It would also assist manufacturers in engineering the
  next generation of larger turbines that will be more flexible and, unless carefully designed, susceptible to wakeinduced
  damage. Field measurements are necessary to increase our knowledge of wind turbine wakes. Although
  important, experiments used to gather such data are costly and difficult given the large scale of wind plants. A
  lower-cost complement to these experiments is LES, the subject of this work.


  Few have performed LES of full wind plants.
