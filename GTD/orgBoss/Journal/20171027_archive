Good god, no. The company I work for is pretty deep in Microsoft land, so at a very minimum I need to keep a Windows VM around for Lync and (to some extent) Outlook. Similarly, despite the advances made by Emacs in the area, I doubt I'll be replacing the web browser with Emacs any time soon, web apps (like the Atlassian tools) are way too heavily integrated at my workplace. Code wise I'm happy with Emacs, but then again I don't write Java.

As a professional developer, I think it's important not to get too attached to the tools. They exist to help us solve problems, and when one tool doesn't cut it you pick a different one for the job.
