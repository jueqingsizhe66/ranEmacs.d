** 02:09 what is the story

*** Keep to the point

**** Start with a Lightning talk

 - Talk about something specific within 5 minutes
 - Realise you will over-run 5 minutes (everyone does) 
 - Get some feedback on the content
   - what did developers find interesting
   - what do developers want to hear more about 

**** Have a basic structures

You are telling a story, so there is a begining, middle and end 

Begining
 - tell people why the subject is interesting (context)

Middle
 -  the meat of the story, what happens, how does it happen

End
 - what was the point of the story, what should the audience do next
