I saw this somewhere, but cannot find it now. Is there a built-in function in emacs, or does someone have elisp, to line up all the equals signs in a series of inititialization statments in cc-mode?

Before:

int t=9;
Graphics g = new Graphics();
List<String> list = new List<String>();

After:

int          t    = 9;
Graphics     g    = new Graphics();
List<String> list = new List<String>();
