   Abstract = {Installation of blades for wind turbines is challenging due to large lifting height and high precision. Assessment of blade dynamic responses during installation needs advanced simulation tools which are limited at present. This paper aims at developing an integrated simulation tool SIMO-Aero for single blade installation for both onshore and offshore wind turbines. Based on the cross-flow principle, the aerodynamic model is established by accounting for the effect of wind turbulence and dynamic stall. Then it is coupled with SIMO to achieve the integrated simulation tool SIMO-Aero which can account for blade aerodynamics, vessel hydrodynamics and system mechanical couplings. The aerodynamic code is verified by code-to-code comparisons with HAWC2. Furthermore, SIMO-Aero is applied in case studies on the wind-induced dynamic responses of a DTU 10?MW blade during installation using a jack-up crane vessel which is assumed to be rigid, including the crane, and rigidly fixed to the seabed. The characteristics of system dynamic responses prior to mating the blade onto the hub are studied. It is shown that the blade motions are dominated by the pendulum motion. Critical parameters of the installation process are identified. The extreme responses of critical parameters are further studied under turbulent winds and wind gusts.},

Within this project, the research unit of the University of Perugia (UniPG) aims to develop dynamic modeling and simulation methodologies and fatigue behavior evaluation ones for wind turbine as a whole. The development of these methodologies will be aimed at predicting the life of generic wind turbines, also providing important and fundamental parameters for optimizing their control, aimed at reducing the failures of these machines. In the present paper, a small turbine, developed at the Department of Engineering of the University of Perugia, will be analyzed. The multibody modeling technique adopted and the experimental activity conducted in the wind tunnel of UniPG, needed for the tuning of the model, will be described. The analysis of both model behavior and experimental data has allowed for the definition of a robust multibody modeling technique that adopts a freeware code (NREL - FAST), universally considered to be a reference in this field. The goodness of the model guarantees the capabilities of the simulation environment to analyze the real load scenario and the fatigue behavior of this kind of device.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the sources of cyclic loads affecting the structural solicitation and power production in Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines, in particular the role of blade-section misalignment. These loads could become determinant in future designs of extra-large turbines, limiting lifespan due to fatigue of structural and mechanical components. Gravity loads would also become more significant in future up-scaled machines due to the square-cube law relation between energy capture and rotor mass. We identify the different constructive factors and physical mechanisms which constitute the sources of the cyclic loads on the rotor, and present a methodology to analyze the contribution of each one of them. We propose six hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the individual effect of each of the aforementioned sources on the aerodynamic and structural variables that characterize the operational state of the turbine. We analyze the evolution of aerodynamic variables which characterize rotor interference and its relation with the angle of attack on the blade sections. Structural variables are also analyzed, showing the contribution of both aerodynamic and gravity loads, inducing out-of-plane bending and torsional oscillations, and how these could be activated by bend-twist coupling on the blade structural response.},

   Abstract = {The renewable energy industry is thriving in many countries against a global backdrop of growing environmental awareness. In particular, in Taiwan, wind is emerging as a potential source. The Taiwanese government has implemented the “Thousand Wind Turbines” project as a collaboration with the private sector to construct a wind power infrastructure. However, when Typhoon Soudelor hit Taiwan on August 7–8, 2015, the towers of 2.0?MW wind turbines close to Taichung harbor collapsed and falling blades damaged one of the collapsed turbine towers. This incident of wind turbine collapse was the second in the nation and was more extensive than the previous one. This study investigates the causes of this incident and the mechanical mechanisms of turbine tower collapse and blade fracture to support risk prevention and hazard-resistant design of future wind turbines. Relevant data are obtained to simulate wind turbine collapse. Next, mechanical analyses via finite element method are carried out to identify mechanisms of failure and structural weakness planes, with the ultimate purpose of summarizing potential causes of collapse. Improvement solutions on strong wind resistance of wind turbine towers and their benefits are discussed. Finally, this study gives the recommendations on weaker blades being a safety mechanism for the wind turbine tower, torque capacity of the pitch system as well as the required strength of joint bolts to be installed in steel structural connections, so as to withstand severe storms.},
