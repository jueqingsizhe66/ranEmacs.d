   Abstract = {This paper presents the most recent results from the EU project AVATAR in which aerodynamic models are improved and validated for wind turbines on a scale of 10 MW and more. Measurements on a DU 00-W-212 airfoil are presented which have been taken in the pressurized DNW-HDG wind tunnel up to a Reynolds number of 15 Million. These measurements are compared with measurements in the LM wind tunnel for Reynolds numbers of 3 and 6 Million and with calculational results. In the analysis of results special attention is paid to high Reynolds numbers effects. CFD calculations on airfoil performance showed an unexpected large scatter which eventually was reduced by paying even more attention to grid independency and domain size in relation to grid topology. Moreover calculations are presented on flow devices (leading and trailing edge flaps and vortex generators). Finally results are shown between results from 3D rotor models where a comparison is made between results from vortex wake methods and BEM methods at yawed conditions.},

   Abstract = {The flatback airfoil effect on the inboard region of a large wind turbine blade was investigated by numerical analysis. Complicated flow phenomena in wind turbine blade with flatback and non-flatback airfoil were captured by Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow simulation with shear stress transport turbulence model. Although both airfoil blades were designed using blade element momentum theory to produce identical shaft power, results of three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow analysis indicated that at a specific location of the root area, the flatback airfoil improved the inboard force by approximately 6 % compared with the non-flatback airfoil. We were also able to confirm that by using the flatback airfoil, the overall shaft power throughout the blade increased by 1 %, thereby restraining the bending moment exerted by the thrust force on the hub by 0.5 %. Moreover, numerical analysis results indicated that the flatback airfoil blade reduced the size of the secondary vortex around the blade root area and its progress in the secondary direction in comparison with the non-flatback airfoil blade. The shape of the flatback airfoil on the trailing edge weakened the adverse pressure gradient migrating from the lower to the upper surface. Regardless of the flatback airfoils, the tip vortex core of the outboard region formed on the suction surface leading edge and strongly rolled up by the pressure surface boundary layers due to the large pressure difference between the suction and pressure surfaces in the blade tip region. This remarkable strong tip vortex developed downstream and raked up the boundary layer of the blade trailing edge with low energy.},

Preliminary studies regarding the time step size and the number of rotor revolution required for the time averaging procedure are conducted. In the blade outer region, URANS is sufficient to predict the general flow characteristics, but small discrepancies are observed in the blade root area where the flow is massively separated.},
