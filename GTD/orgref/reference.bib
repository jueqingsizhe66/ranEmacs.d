   Abstract = {ABSTRACT  Wind turbines represent a rapidly growing source of renewable energy but current predictive tools have been shown to lack accuracy in predicting the power output of wind turbines. Additionally, wind farm performance must be properly predicted to develop accurate annual energy estimates. An aeroelastic, aeroacoustic, discrete vortex code called SmartRotor was used to predict the performance of the benchmark National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine experiment. The code properly predicted the NREL wind turbine performance in normal and yawed flow conditions and has demonstrated the capability of simulating the wake interference effects present in wind farms. The grid-free characterization of the wake behind the turbine and the rapid simulation time compared with grid-based computational fluid dynamics solvers highlights the relevance of the code for industrial applications.},

Two kinds of motions are applied for calculating the dynamic yaw stability derivatives CNr and CNβ. The first one relates to a lateral translation and, separately, to a yaw rotation. The second one consists of a combined translational and rotational motion. To determine dynamic yaw stability derivatives, the simulation of an unsteady flow with a bird model showing a harmonic motion is performed. The flow solution for each time step is obtained by solving unsteady Euler equations based on a finite volume approach for a small reduced frequency. Then, an evaluation of unsteady forces and moments for one cycle is conducted using harmonic Fourier analysis. The results of the dynamic yaw stability derivatives for both simulations of the model show a good agreement.},

   Title = {Effects of yawed flow on wind turbine rotors},
   Abstract = {ABSTRACT  The effect of yawed flow on wind turbine rotors is examined. Results are obtained from two theoretical approaches. The first theoretical analysis involves the development and investigation of a smplified computer algorithm. The algorithm is derived from fundamental rotor equations and is used to study the effects of yawed flow on steady-state, average rotor performance. The second theoretical analysis is dynamic simulation of a rotor in yawed flow. The analysis is based on blade element theory and dynamic inflow theory, and neglects stall effects. The analysis is designed to calculate local aerodynamic forces and moments blade angle-of-attack profiles, induced flow profiles, and teeter or passive cyclic pitch deflections for rotors with a teetering axis or with cyclic pitch. A state-variable approach is used with a predictor-corrector solution to the system of first-order differential equations in order to obtain a time-history solution. Applications of the dynamic simulation model are used to investigate operating limits due to stall, gust response, and passive cyclic pitch response. Correlations are presented with the simplified theory and with experimental results, where applicable. Experimental results are presented from wind tunnel tests in which a model rotor was operated in yawed flow. The results are compared with other wind tunnel test results and with some theoretical results. Experimental results are also peresented from atmospheric tests of a 7.6 meter (25 ft) diameter, two-bladed, yaw-controlled wind turbine with passive cyclic pitch. Comparisons between the theoretical approaches and the experimental data show that both computer models are useful in analyzing the effects of yawed flow on wind turbine rotor performance.},

   Abstract = {Dominant flow structures in the wake region behind the turbine employed in the Blind Test campaign [1], [2] is investigated numerically. The effect on the wake configuration at variable operating conditions are studied. The importance of the introduction of turbine tower inside the numerical framework is highlighted. High-fidelity simulations are performed with Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) numerical methodology. A thorough comparison among the cases is presented, and the wake evolution is analyzed at variable stations downstream of the turbine. Streamlines of flow field traveled towards ground adjacent to turbine tower and strongly dependent on the operating tip speed ratio. Wake is composed of tower shadow superimposed by rotor wake. Shadow of the tower varies from x/R =2 until x/R =4 and breaks down into small vortices with the interaction of rotor wake. This study also shows that the wake distribution consists of two zones; inner zone composed of disturbances generated by blade root, nacelle and the tower, and an outer zone consisting of tip vortices.

   Abstract = {To optimize the power extraction from the wind, horizontal-axis wind turbines are normally manipulated by the yaw control system to track the wind direction. How is the potential power extraction efficiency of such wind turbines related to the parameter optimization of a yaw control system? We intend to answer this question in this study. First, we develop two control systems, a direct measurement-based conventional logic control (Control system 1), and a soft measurement-based advanced model predictive control (Control system 2). Then, a multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization-based method is introduced to optimize control parameters and search for the Pareto Front, which represents different potential performance. On this basis, result investigation and analysis are carried out on an electrical yaw system of China Ming Yang 1.5 MW wind turbines based on three wind directions with different variations. Experimental results show that, under a large wind direction variation and with a 14% yaw actuator usage, 0.32% and 0.8% more power extraction efficiency are gained by Control system 1 and 2, respectively, after optimization. The achievable power extraction efficiency for the two yaw control systems goes down when the allowable yaw actuator usage is reduced. For instance, when the yaw actuator usage is 14%, 4.9% and 2%, the efficiency is 97.19%, 96.76% and 96.37% for Control system 1, and is 97.73%, 96.76% and 95.45% for Control system 2, respectively. Therefore, Control system 2 takes precedence over Control system 1 for having higher efficiency when the allowable yaw actuator usage is more than 4.9%. We also find that the potential power extraction efficiency of the two control systems is significantly influenced by the wind direction variation, that is, the optimized efficiency under small wind direction variation is 1.5% higher than that under large wind direction variation. In addition, the parameters of Control system 1 need to be re-optimized according to the wind condition, whereas the ones of Control system 2 may not. Finally, a novel yaw control strategy employing the optimized parameters as the query tables is suggested for the real applications.},

Various noise generation models developed at DTU are described and analyzed, including models based on the acoustic analogy, flow-acoustics splitting techniques, Amiet's model, and various engineering models. Some of the models are coupled to existing aero-elastic software and computational fluid mechanics models developed at DTU, and implemented in the simulation platform WindSTAR (Wind turbine Simulation Tool for AeRodynamic noise). This simulation platform consists of WindSTAR-Gen, dealing with models for generation of noise and design of low-noise wind turbines, and WindSTAR-Pro, which is developed to handle the modeling of long distance acoustic propagation. As specific features of the WindSTAR-Pro package, the rotation of the noise sources is modeled, the propagation simulations combine the so-called Parabolic Equations (PE) propagation model with numerical flow simulations to take into account effects from wind turbine wakes, atmospheric turbulence and wind shear.},

   Abstract = {偏航工况水平轴风力机存在典型的动态特性，为了提高动态载荷特性的预测精度，该文采用计算流体力学方法（computational fluid dynamics，CFD）研究了MEXICO（model experiments in controlled conditions）风轮在偏航角0、15&#176;、30&#176;、45&#176;工况下的整机气动性能。数值模拟得到的叶片截面压力系数分布、载荷系数随方位角变化规律以及轴向入流时速度分布与试验测量值均吻合较好。当偏航角在30&#176;以内时，采用CFD方法计算的轴向载荷系数的相对误差在&#177;5%以内，切向载荷系数的相对误差在&#177;15%以内；当偏航角达到45&#176;时，轴向载荷系数的相对误差超过&#177;15%，切向载荷系数的相对误差接近&#177;30%，同时偏航运行时速度分布与试验测量相差较大。偏航运行时叶根处的翼型升阻力迟滞特性较叶尖处显著，但叶根处攻角变化范围小于叶尖处。采用动量叶素法进行风力机性能预测时必需充分考虑该特性。该研究为工程预测模型的建立和偏航工况风力机设计运行提供了参考。
A typical dynamic characteristic of horizontal axis wind turbine shows up under yaw condition. Prediction accuracy is low for momentum-blade element theory and related engineering prediction model. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of dynamic load characteristics, the whole wind turbine models, based on the experiment about MEXICO (model experiments in controlled conditions) rotor in 2006, are established by three-dimensional software called Pro/E. under different yaw conditions, i.e. yaw angle of 0, 15, 30 and 45 degree. ICEM CFD (integrated computer engineering and manufacturing code for computational fluid dynamics) is applied to grid division. The rotating domain containing rotor part is meshed into hexahedral grids, and the static domain containing part of wheel hub, tower and outflow field is meshed into tetrahedral grids. When the grid size of the first layer of blade surface is set as 5&#215;10-6 m to ensure the first dimensionless size near the wall Y+&lt;0.5 on the wall, the 2 numbers of grids are determined by the error of axial load on the airfoil in the 60%section of blades, which respectively are 6 572 451 and 2 961 385. The aerodynamic performance of models under rated condition is simulated by ANSYS CFX with the turbulence model of SST (shear stress transport), high resolution is chosen as advection scheme, and transient rotor stator as the domain interface method. The results are converted into data, processed and analyzed by MATLAB. Finally the following conclusions are drawn. The distributions of pressure coefficients along the airfoil chord in different blade sections calculated by CFD method are in good agreement with the experimental measurements, and the error on the suction surface of airfoil is mainly caused by stall separation occurring on the pressure surface of airfoil. With the increasing of yaw angle, the pressure coefficients of the suction side are increasing and the location of minimum pressure coefficient moves to airfoil trailing edge slightly. For the pressure side, the pressure coefficients increase at first and then decrease, and the location of maximum pressure coefficient moves to airfoil leading edge slightly. The axial load coefficients and tangential load coefficients of blades first decrease and then increase and then decrease again with the increase of the azimuthal angle. With the increase of the yaw angle, the axial and tangential load coefficients are both reduced. When the yaw angle is within 30&#176;, the relative error of axial load coefficients is in the range of &#177;5% and the relative error of tangential load coefficients is in the range of &#177;15%. CFD method is higher than BEM (blade element momentum) method in forecasting accuracy of dynamic load calculation. Under yaw condition, the hysteresis characteristic of airfoil lift and drag in blade root is more remarkable than blade tip, while the variation range of the angle of attack in blade root is much less than that in blade tip. This characteristic must be considered when BEM method is used to predict wind turbine performance. For axial inflow condition, CFD method can well predict the average speed, but restricted by turbulence model and the wake model, CFD calculation did not show the velocity characteristics of rotating vortex shedding from wind turbine impeller under yaw condition. The study provides a data support to build up the forecast model on the engineering and provides the basis for wind turbine design under yaw condition.},

   Abstract = {自然界风具有阵发性、涡动性、不均匀性。扰动入流风对水平轴风力机不仅影响其出力及其结构,对噪声污染也有着不可忽视的影响。本文以风洞实验为基础,利用ANSYS FLUENT加载扰动入流函数,并结合IDDES(Improve Detached-eddy Simulation)湍流模型和声学FW-H方程对某S翼型水平轴风力机流场和声场进行数值模拟研究,探索在均匀入流和扰动入流下风力机旋转流动特性和声辐射规律,进一步分析湍流强度对风力机气动特性和噪声的影响。风轮流场模拟结果表明,相对于均匀入流,在扰动入流下风轮压力面受到非均匀风和旋转的惯性力作用,压力面静压梯度分布略低,吸力面较大;均匀入流时叶片前缘处的压力系数大于扰动入流工况,随叶展方向增大,截面上压力系数趋于一致;脉动压力监测显示,脉动压力值在两种入流方式下都在叶片中部(0.57R附近)最大,叶尖位置其次,叶根处最小,而均匀入流脉动峰值一致,扰动入流时峰值不同;涡量云图显示在均匀入流下,叶片的0.71R处产生明显的分离流动和叶片尾缘脱落涡,扰动入流在0.57R处则更为强烈;功率在额定尖速比时最大并和实验值最接近,并当尖速比小于额定情况时,扰动入流条件功率更接近实验值,大于额定尖速比时,两种入流方式对功率的影响较小。入流的涡动性引起流场切向和法向扰动,并影响声的传播。在流场分析的基础上,进一步对风轮气动噪声进行分析:声压脉动时均值云图显示风力机噪声源都位于叶片前缘位置,其分布与叶片旋转造成的最大压差分布位置一致;频谱分析指出,两种入流方式声能量主要集中在500Hz内的低频噪声,随着频率增大均匀入流声压级逐渐减小,扰动入流因扰动涡流造成的高频宽带噪声随频率的增大会出现新的峰值;在120°和180°相位角各截面的声压级分析得出,噪声的传播随距声源越远强度越弱,均匀入流声传播特性较为规律,而扰动入流和实验值在传播过程中出现无规律的跳动现象,且都在轴向距离10cm至50cm处声压级下降最快,与实验值规律一致。对不同入口湍流强度对风力机的影响分析指出:当湍流强度由0.2%增加至4%,功率降低了5.07%,测试点噪声增加了12.7dB,湍流强度增至10%时,功率降低11.35%,测试点声压级增加了19.86dB。最后,得出不同入流条件下对风力机气动性能、噪声传播等的影响,为风力机在使用过程中能达到高性能、低噪声提供依据,也为风洞条件下风力机研究提供参考。},
