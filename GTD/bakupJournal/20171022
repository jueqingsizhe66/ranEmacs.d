** 15:11 Lisp fantasity

What makes LISP such a fantastic language is that the source code
and data structures are intrinsically one and the same:
the lisp source code you read as a human is almost identical to
how the code is manipulated as a data structure by lisp---the distinction
between the questions "What is data?" and "What is code" are nil

The data as code,the macro system and the ability to "advise" arbitrary
functions--meaning you can modify the behavior of existing code without
copying and modifying the original---give you an unprecedented ability
to alter Emacs to suit your needs.

You can *hook* , replace or alter existing routines in Emacs to suit
your needs without rewriting large swathes of someone else's source 
code.

Emacs is a living systems. When you write elisp, you are not just
writing snippets of code run in a sandbox, isolated from everything
It is a living system; an operationg system running on an operating
system. It is an interpreter

** 15:39 what is buffer in emacs

The buffer is the data structure(this is very important(extremely powerful concept 
because the very same command you use to move around and edit in Emacs
are almost always the same ones you use behind-the-scenes in elisp.

** 15:45 window

Think of it as a physical window having a frame, each 
frame made up of window panes(each window is an window)

why introduce the Point and mark!

keystrokes(key bindings) 

.emacs.d init.el and .eamcs

Major mode and minor mode(key function  highlight --one file extension bind to only one major mode)

** 15:54 font locking

Font locking is the correct term for syntax high-lighting in Emacs, and in turn
is made up of faces of properties(color, font, text size, text style etc) that
the font locking engines use to pretty-point the text.

You are free to change a buffer's major mode at any time by typing the command
for another one.

** 16:03 client-server

Emacs has a client-server architecture(emacs client-server mode)
Emacs --daemon will run emacs as a daemon. It will call server-start,
as above, but will return control to your terminal immediately and run
in background ,waiting for client requests.

** 16:13 M-x

M-x means the execute extended command(M-x) interface and key bindings

So if you're a package author, you have to choose if a particular function 
is accessible to the end-user through the M-x interface(Mx) . Marking 
it as interactive will make it accessible to the end users.

In other words, if it's not interactive ,you cannot run it from M-x nor 
can you bind it to a key

** 16:39 You know what's my talents?

That is what I want? That is why I came here.

** 16:42 Self-documenting editor

Emacs is a sophisticated self-documenting editor. Every facet of
emacs is searchable or describable. Learning how to do this
is absolutely esssential to mastering Emacs.

I use emacs's self-documenting functionality all the time.

Knowing how to get help is critical because
1. emacs knows best .
2. you will find more beautiful and functional features in emacs.

** 16:47 emacs document system

diveded into 3 parts
1. the info manual
2. Apropos(Emacs has an extensive apropos systems that works in much the same 
way as apropos does on the command line.The Apropos system is specially useful
if you 're not entirely sure what you are looking for.(C-h a: M-x apropos-command)
(Hint : Apropos can sort results by relevancy . To enable this
add (setq apropos-sort-by-scores t)
3. the describle system---a living system which describe yourself system.(your

personalize Emacs(M-x describe-mode or C-h m   
C-h f: M-x describe-function
C-h v: M-x describe-variable
C-h k: M-x describe-key

** DONE 16:57 the theory of movement

Getting around, and getting around efficiently, is as important as 
knowing how to edit quickly and efficiently.

But movement in Emacs is more than characters in a buffer.
There's a host of supplementary skills that make up navigation,
like understanding Emacs's rather complicated windowing system.

I've laid things out ,so you can start at the beginning and work
your way through, picking up bits and pieces as you read. The most important
part, as I've stressed many times, is to give it time and practice 
take a moment in your day-to-day life to ask yourself if there's a 
better way of solving with which you are faced

** 17:24 syntax table

syntax table let you choose which is the comment character,
what character make up a word?(symbol. punctuation,comment etc)
as a syntactic unit . So when you move the point around on
the screen, it moves according to the syntax table 
and the general rules governing forward-word and backward-word

Every editor has an equivalent of Emacs's syntax table, but
what sets Emacs apart from other editors is that 
you can inspect and change the syntax table, which in turn will
effect how you invoke certain commands.
