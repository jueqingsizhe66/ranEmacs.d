Choosing Themes
You can choose from several built in presentations, including default, beige, sky, night (my favorite), serif, simple, moon

You can also make your own theme by creating a new CSS file and defining styles to for that theme.

Define which theme you want using the code:

* Transitions
There are several built in styles of transition effects to move from one slide to another. I find linear the most pleasing, as it simply slides the content in from the right or bottom to. Cube is quite a nice rotating cube in the middle of the screen, so you may not get the full benefit of a wide screen display. Zoom is a bit to much for my delicate eyes.

The available tranistions include: default, cube, page, concave, zoom, linear, fade, none

Define a transition before any of the slide content (before the first heading) using the code:

#+REVEAL_TRANS: linear    

* title1
* title 2
** sub-title 2.1
** sub-title 2.2
* title 3


* A very interesting slide

**This slide is interesting because I am a geek :)
  - bullet points can be added in moderation
  - dont get too carried away with them

* Effects within Slides


#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- all these bullet-points
- show up on the page
- as soon as its shown


#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-red
- this last one is then highlighted in red

* Fragment Styles

Available fragment styles are:

    grow
    shrink
    roll-in
    fade-out
    highlight-red
    highlight-green
    highlight-blue
    appear

Setting :frag t will use Reveal.js default fragment style, which can be overridden by local option #+REVEAL_DEFAULT_FRAG_STYLE
 or global variable org-reveal-default-frag-style.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow shrink roll-in fade-out none) :frag_idx (4 3 2 1 -)
   * I will grow.
   * I will shrink.
   * I rolled in.
   * I will fade out.
   * I don't fragment.

** Fragment Index

Fragment sequence can be changed by assigning adding :frag_idx property to
 each fragmented element.
And, this paragraph shows at last.
This paragraph shows secondly.
This paragraph shows at first.

** List Fragments

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag frag-style above a list defines fragment style for the list as a whole.

    All items grow.
    As a whole.

To define fragment styles for every list item, please enumerate each item’s style in a lisp list.

none in the style list will disable fragment for the corresponding list item.

Custom fragment sequence should also be enumerated for each list item.
