 Numerical study on unsteady aerodynamic Characters of a horizontal wind turbine under yaw 


Abstract: The aerodynamics under yaw is important to horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) since it often works under yaw due to the continuous changes of wind direction. In addition, yaw can be used as one of control methods for load reduction and wake direction of HAWT. The aerodynamics of HAWT under yaw show highly unsteady characters. The Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations have been performed in this paper on the NREL Phase VI wind turbine. The simulation results were compared with experimental data and Blade Element Momentum (BEM) results in terms of overall aerodynamic performance and surface pressure coefficient of the blade, as well as the normal and tangential force coefficients at selected radial sections. The comparisons show that the CFD results have better agreement with the experimental data than both BEM results with and without Beddoes model. The overall power of wind turbine decreases according to a cosine law with the increase of yaw angle. The torque shows more low frequency harmonics than the non-yawed condition due to root vorticity influence. The maximum coefficient of the azimuthal-averaged load moves from midspan to outer span with the yaw angle increasing. The transient load of blade at the azimuth angle between -45◦ to 45◦ decreases almost monotonically for all yaw angles, while it increases firstly then decreases when the azimuth angle is between 45◦ and 315◦ due to the variation of effective angle of attack. Three-dimensional effect of stall presents obvious load fluctuations at the inner board of blade, and becomes stronger with yaw angle increasing. The fluctuated load becomes more prominent in the retreating side than that of the advancing side.

1 Introduction
Wind power has been developed rapidly in past decades. The aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine is the key point of wind power generation. Due to stochastic property of wind, the wind direction changes continuously. Thus, the wind turbine often works under yaw where the rotor disk is not perpendicular to the wind direction. Under a yawed condition, the upstream wind has a velocity component that is parallel to the wind turbine rotational plane, leading to a periodic variation of the angle of attack of the blade [1]. The aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine under yaw, as well as the bypass flow, show highly unsteady characters, resulting high fatigue load and degrading the operational life of wind turbine. Insightful understanding of the unsteady characters of the aerodynamic performance and surrounding flow of wind turbine under yaw has significances for wind turbine design.
The aerodynamics of wind turbine under yaw have been investigated extensively using both experiments and numerical simulations. The detailed aerodynamic performance measurements along the blade in combination with the detailed flow field measurements help to understand the flow mechanism of a wind turbine to the incoming flow filed. Hand et al. performed wind tunnel experiments on NREL Phase VI, a two-blade wind turbine, providing a benchmark for evaluation of the wind turbine aerodynamic simulations [2]. Pressure and aerodynamic force coefficients were obtained at different radial locations under five yawed cases (0◦, 10◦, 30◦, 45◦ and 45◦). The angle of attack was found varying with the blade azimuth in approximate sinusoidal function. Schepers et al. performed wind tunnel experiments on a three-bladed wind turbine, MEXICO rotor[3] under three yaw angles (15◦, 30◦, 45◦). Sectional aerodynamic force and torque variation with azimuth angle were obtained. It is found that the previous proposed aerodynamic models, which assume the azimuthal variation of the induced velocity to be sinusoidal corresponding with the skewed tip vortex wake at yaw, are not correct at the inner span of the blade due to the velocities induced by the root vortices. Sant T. investigated the TUDelft reference rotor in an open jets wind tunnel under both axial and yawed conditions[4]. Detailed measurements of the near wake and smoke visualizations of the tip vortex were performed. The limitations of Blade Element Moment (BEM) method to the skewed wake under yawed conditions were assessed. Based on the work of Schepers et al., Micallef et al. performed stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV) measurements to study the blade aerodynamic performance and near wake development in axial and yawed flows[5]. They found that under yaw the flow in windward region exhibited inboard motion due to rapid motion of the tip vortices away from the blade. In field test, Ven et al.[6] applied an in-field measurements to investigated the yawed turbine inflow. In blade spanwise, an imbalance in the crossflow fraction is shown between azimuth angles of 90°and 270°. This phenoma is caused by yawed inflow which leads an inwash and outwash on the blade surface. Dai et al.[7] give a detailed investigation of yaw effect based on SCADA data, presenting the characteristic of power coefficient and rotor torque under yaw. 
The numerical methods to evaluate the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine mainly include Blade Element Momentum (BEM), Vortex Theory (VT) and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD). The most commonly used method is BEM, which is fast and costs low computational effort. Ryu et al.[8] developed a successive under-relaxation technique with the classical BEM complemented by several aerodynamic corrections and models, to computed the specified radial locations of the blade, and found the yaw error causes the periodic change of the angle of attack on the blade element. Yaw results in an asymmetric flow field where the relative velocity magnitude and direction both vary with time. Yaw has influence not only on the wake flow behind the wind turbine, but on the surface flow of blade and three-dimensional aerodynamic characteristics of rotor[9]. However, the non-uniform flow between blades is stilled modeled with a simplified wake model based the Prandtl tip loss factor. Moreover, the time constant used in the dynamic inflow models has unreal drop at the tip region. Both the tip loss model and dynamic inflow model can be possible improved by free vortex wake methods which combining the blade aerodynamic and wake flow computational model. Qiu et al. [10] investigated aerodynamic load distributions of blade under yawed conditions with an improved lift line method that introduces a wake model comprising vortex sheet model and tip vortex model, finding that the yaw rate and dynamic wake affect the shaft torque of the blade in the yawing process. Micallef et al. [11]erformed experimental and numerical investigations of tip vortex generation and evolution on horizontal axis wind turbines under yaw. Vorticity strength on suction side under non-yawed condition were observed to become more concentrated than yawed condition where the vorticity spreads over a small region at the tip. The vortex shedding is observed at outboard.
Although a bunch of aerodynamic corrections, such as Pitt and Peter’s yaw correction[12-13], Suzuki’s dynamic inflow model[14], Prandtl’s tip loss model, Du and Selig’s[15] three-dimensional stall delay model and Buhl’s wake correction[16], have been proposed and widely used, classical BEM and FWM are still not sufficiently reliable for predicting the aerodynamic load distributions on the wind turbine blades, especially for the yawed and stalled rotor conditions. Some investigations using more accurate CFD simulations have been performed to investigate the complicated yaw aerodynamic problem of wind turbine, with the visualization of detailed three dimensional flow. Tongchitpakdee[17] investigated the NREL PhaseVI case at several wind speeds and four yaw angles, finding that at low wind speeds（~7m/s）under low yaw angles the flow remains attached over most region of the rotor. At high yaw angles (45 and 60 degrees), there is less flow separation over the upper surface at the high wind speeds. Yu et al.[18] performed time-accurate aerodynamic simulations of the NREL Phase VI wind turbine rotor under yawed flow conditions. They found that periodic fluctuation of blade loading at the retreating side had higher magnitudes than the advancing side. Schulz et al. investigated the generic 2.4MW wind turbine with two different speeds and yaw angle ranges between -50° and 50° with FLOWer CFD solver [19], revealing that yaw has influence in the inboard region of the blade. The variations of the spanwise load gradients, especially for higher yaw angle, were presented. Jeong et al. investigated the effects of yaw errors on the aerodynamic and aeroelastic behaviors of NREL 5MW HAWT blade [20], and pointed out that the impacts of yaw misalignments adversely influenced the dynamic aeroelastic stability of the horizontal axis wind turbine blade. Dai et al.[21] performed aeroealstic investigation on the Tjæreborg wind turbine under yaw, finding that the fluid solid coupling givers higher averaged power and thrust, as well as violent oscillation amplitude. 
Yaw could be also used for load reduction or wake redirection of wind turbine [22]. Adaramola [23] carried out the experimental investigation of wake interference effects on two wind turbines performance, and found that operation in upstream turbine in yawed condition, total power output from two turbines could be increased by about 12%. Recent work has provided a proof of concept for a data-driven optimization control scheme that yaw control to change the wake trajectory in a high-fidelity wind plant simulation [24-25].
Summarizing the reference survey, the azimuthal variation behavior of wind turbine aerodynamics under yaw is seldom discussed in detail. The mechanism of aerodynamic variation along spanwise of the wind turbine under yaw is still not very clear. In present paper, unsteady CFD simulations have been performed to investigate the azimuthal variation of aerodynamic performance at different span sections under static yaw status. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the geometry model and computational method. In section 3, the static yaw simulation results are compared with experimental data. The discussion mainly focus on the sectional azimuthal variations of aerodynamic force coefficients. Section 4 summarizes the conclusions drawn in this paper.
2 Numerical Model
2.1 Computational Model and Numerical methods
The wind turbine investigated in this paper is the NREL Phase VI wind turbine, a two-blade wind turbine. The airfoil of the blade is S809 airfoil. The rotor diameter is 10.058m, and hub height is 12.192m. The rotational speed is 71.9rpm. The experiment were performed in the NASA Ames wind tunnel in 1999, which has been considered a benchmark for evaluation of the wind turbine aerodynamic computer model. Detailed geometry parameters and experimental description can be found in NREL report[2].
2.2 Computational Domain and boundary conditions
According to the simulation results from Yu et al.[18], the loads are almost the same for rotor-alone model and full wind turbine model. To reduce the computational cost and time, only the wind turbine rotor is modelled in this paper. 
The computational domain as shown in Fig. 1 is a rectangle zone with 9.5D in length and 8D in width, where D stands for the rotor diameter. The computational domain is divided into two zones: a rotational zone and a stationary zone. The rotational zone is a cylinder with diameter of 1.5D and height of 0.5D. The distance between the inlet and the rotational cylinder is 3D. The rotor is located at the center of the rotational zone. 
Fig. 2 shows the boundary conditions used in the simulations. Uniform wind speed of 7m/s is set as the inlet of the domain with turbulence intensity of 5%. The boundary conditions for the top and down plane in the domain are free-slip and no-slip walls. The blade surface is set to no-slip wall.  The pressure outlet condition is assumed to outlet of the domain. For simplification, the rotational axis is fixed, while the inlet velocity direction varies to generate different angles to mimic the yaw condition.

2.3 Computational Grid
Fig.3 shows the grid in the rotational zone, which is generated using AutoGrid from NUMECA software . The grid number for this zone is 4.79 million. The total grid number including stationary zone is about 6.7 million. In order to resolve the boundary layer, the grids around the blades are refined to keep the y+ less than 5 on the blade surface.

2.4 Numerical methods
Commercial software CFX is used to solve the unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations(URANS). The k-  Transition SST turbulent model is set for turbulence modelling, considering the laminar and transitional effects at the blade surface. The sliding mesh technique is used for data exchange between the rotational zone and the stationary zone. For the time-accurate calculations, a dual-time implicit time integration algorithm based on linearized second-order Euler backward differencing is used. The time-step size equivalent to a rotor azimuthal increment of 2.5°, coupled with 20 pseudo-time sub-iterations. The residual of the continuity equation is reduced by at least three orders throughout the calculations. For comparison, BEM computations using FAST software were also performed. 
2.4.2 Extracting blade element physical characters
Fig. 4 illustrates the definition of yaw angle and azimuth angle of wind turbine rotor. Yaw angle is defined as the angle between inflow and the rotational axis. Fig. 4(b) describes the azimuth angle in detail. The wind turbine rotates counter-clockwise, defining Blade 2 at 12 clock position as 0° azimuth angle. 
In order to obtain the spanwise variation of the aerodynamic loads, the blade is divided into 17 independent spanwise sections. At each section, the pressure is integrated in the chord-wise direction and resolved in the global coordinate system, rather than a coordinate system aligned with the local chord line to produce the spanwise variation of the normal and tangential forces coefficient (Cn and Ct), as shown in Fig. 5. Here, the axial force coefficient, refers to the force component parallel with the global Z axis, and the tangential force coefficient, refers to the force component parallel to the global X axis. Therefore, the axial and tangential forces represent the thrust producing force and the torque producing force acting on the airfoil.

Fig. 4. Wind turbine rotor yaw angle and blade azimuth angle    Fig. 5. Definition of Aerodynamic force coefficients
	     If yaw angle is zero, the syntactic velocity keep the same in one rotational resolution, which can be calculated as follows,
	  .	(1)
When yaw angle is not zero, the syntactic velocity need to be updated with the change of azimuth angle. In the yawed cases, as shown in Fig. 6, the azimuth angle is defined as the angle from the red solid arrow line to the black solid arrow line. At zero azimuth angle, the blade is retreating the tangent component of inflow velocity, leading to a lower relative velocity and a higher angle of attack. On the other hand, at azimuth angle of 180°, the blade is advancing toward the velocity component aligned tangent to the rotor plane, leading to a higher relative velocity and a lower angle of attack. Neglecting of the change of pitch angle due to the torsional deformation along the blade spanwise, the trend of angle of attack relative to the azimuth angle should be identical to the inflow angle. Consequently, for the current case, the angle of attack reaches the maximum and minimum at azimuth angles of 0° and 180°, respectively. The syntactic velocity and the angle of attack at different spans will change continually in one resolution. The inflow angle   defined in Fig. 7 and the relative velocity  can be calculated as follows

 represents the blade tip speed ratio.
When the azimuth angle is between 90°and 270 °(advancing side), the absolute velocity become bigger than that when the azimuth angle is between -90°and 90°(retreating side). At the advancing side, the wind velocity component aligned tangent to the rotor plane is opposite to the linear velocity, so that the relative velocity becomes smaller. At the retreating side, the wind velocity component is in the same direction to the linear velocity, thus the relative velocity becomes larger.

3 Results Analysis and Discussions
Nine unsteady CFD simulations have been performed on static yaw conditions with different inlet velocity angles, 0°, 5°, 10°, 15°, 20°, 25°, 30°, 45° and 60°. The total aerodynamic performance and frequency characteristics were discussed first for results validation. Then, the aerodynamic characteristics and three dimensional stall characteristics at different span sections are discussed in detail.
3.1 Total performance comparison
   The mean square residual for mass and momentum equations at the yaw angle of 30° are shown in Fig.8. The convergence errors are below 10-4. The residual curves for other yaw cases are similar to that of 30° yaw angle. 
   Fig. 9 show the thrust convergence curves under different yaw angles. After about 20 resolutions computation, the curves show periodic oscillations and keep stable. The computations are considered as converged.

Fig. 10a) shows the wind turbine rotor power distribution for nine yaw conditions. The experimental data, the BEM results with and without Beddoes stall model are also presented. It is seen from the comparison that the CFD results give better agreement with experimental data than BEM results, especially for largely yawed conditions. The Beddoes model improves the BEM results under small yaw angles. However, it over amended the BEM results under large yaw angles. Comparing with the result for non-yawed condition, the averaged powers under yaw angle of 10°, 30° and 60°decrease by 4.265%, 29.9% and 86.8%, respectively. Under yawed conditions, the velocity component of the incoming wind normal to the rotor plane decreases by cos( ). While, the power varies approximately in cos2( )~cos3( ) due to the combined effect of wind component normal to the rotor plane and wind component aligned tangent to rotor plane.
The variations of axial thrust for different yaw angles are shown in Fig. 10b). Compared with the result of non-yawed condition, the thrust decrease by 2.32% , 20.37% and 73.98% under yaw angles of 10°,30° and 60°, respectively, which decreases in cos( ) function. For the thrust, the experimental data only for non-yawed condition is available. It is seen that the CFD results has very good agreement with the experimental data. The BEM method over predicates the thrust by about 18%. Same to the power, the Beddoes model improve the BEM performance under small yaw angles. However, it over-amends the BEM results obviously under large yaw angles comparing to CFD results.

Fig. 10. Overall performance distribution for wind turbine rotor under yaw
The blade rotational frequency is 1.198Hz (base frequency). 144 samples of torque are collected in one rotor resolution. The data of last three rotor resolutions are analyzed. Fast Fourier transformation and Hamming window function are applied to get the rotor aerodynamic frequency response due to yaw.
	  	(4)
Fig. 11 shows the torque spectra under different yaw angles around three rotor resolutions. When yaw angle is zero, the spectra main frequency is about 2.3884HZ, corresponding to two times of blade passing frequency, i.e., 2p pulse. The possible reason may be the excitation of crossflow and inflow direction, which has been mentioned by Ven et al. [6] and Shirakashi et al. [26]. Under yawed conditions, some low frequency fluctuations presented. With the increase of the yaw angle, the pulse amplitude become larger. More harmonics with higher frequency are observed, which are mainly caused by the root vorticity effects [4] originating from the blade root as well as shed vorticity at the hub. To investigate the root vorticity effects further, the blade is separated into nine equal length segments in spanwise, as shown in Fig.12a). Fig.12a-d) showed the torque distribution of azimuthal variation at the corresponding blade segment under different yaw angles. The sum of torque at all the total blade segments is equal to the total torque of the whole blade. From Fig12.a), it is seen that there are small fluctuations of torque components at inner span, <30% for the current case, under the non-yawed condition, which is identified in the frequency spectrum Fig11a). However, the torque components at mid span and outer span keep constant during one revolution. Fig12b-d) shows the torque distribution under yawed conditions. The inboard torque distribution presents more fluctuations, especially under high yaw angles (20°~30°). FAST computation results with and without Beddoes model are presented in Fig. 13-14. Only 2p pulse is observed for all conditions. The fluctuations are neglectable.

3.2.1 Radial distribution of aerodynamic force coefficients
Fig. 15 and Fig. 16 show the distributions of the azimuthal averaged pressure coefficient on blade surface at four different span sections under yaw angle of 0° and 30°. In these figures, the instantaneous pressure is averaged over one period of the rotor revolution. The comparison shows that the CFD results have good agreement with experiment data. When wind turbine operates in yawed conditions, the velocity component vertical to the wind rotor rotational surface decreases, and reduces the airfoil aerodynamic performance, which can be clearly seen from the decreasing of the maximum Cp, especially at inner and middle span sections.

Fig. 16 Pressure coefficient distribution at four spanwise position under 30°yaw angle
    In Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, the radial distribution of the azimuthal-averaged normal force coefficient (Cn) and tangential force coefficient (Ct) are presented for four yaw angles. The error bar shows the standard deviation of measurement. It is seen that the computational results have good agreements with experimental data in general, excepting that for yaw angle of 60°. The standard deviation of measurement at the blade root is obviously larger than that at the blade tip, which is due to the strong flow separation and the three-dimensional effect of the centrifugal and Coriolis force at the root. The CFD results exceeds the measurement error bar at outer span when yaw angle reaches 60°, which means RANS simulations have not predicted aerodynamic forces well at the high yaw angle. For small yaw angles, the maximum Cn locates at around 40% span. With increasing of the yaw angle, Cn decreases and the location of maximum Cn moves to outer span. The curve of Cn is getting flat. With increasing of yaw angle, Ct also decreases and the location of maximum Ct moves to inner span.

3.2.2 Transient aerodynamic performance analysis under yaw
Fig.19 shows normal force coefficient distribution varying with the azimuth angle under nine different yaw angles at the radial position r/R=0.3. Three simulation results of CFD, FAST computation with and without Beddoes model are presented. The aerodynamic force coefficient curves are similar in general. CFD results shows a higher magnitude of the Cn at the zero azimuth angle than that of other two models. Due to the influence of spinner, there is a large drop of Cn at around the azimuth angle of 90°since the blade is just at downstream of the spinner. FAST computation with Beddoes model correction shows fluctuations at the zero azimuth angle. The azimuth angle of the minimum blade loading become bigger with the increase of the yaw angle.

The azimuthal variations of the angle of attack (AoA) at four specified locations for one blade (the blade No.2 in Fig.4) are shown in Fig. 20. At the non-yawed condition, the AoA almost keep stable in one resolution. For yawed cases, the AoA shows obvious fluctuations with the change of azimuth angle. With the increase of yaw angle, the amplitude of variation becomes larger.

Fig. 20. angle of attack(AOA) distribution at different azimuth angles under yaw
The azimuthal variations of aerodynamic force coefficient for one blade2 under yaw angle of 0°, 10° and 30° are show in Figs. 21-22 respectively. For the non-yawed condition, the angle of attack (AoA) and other variables almost keep the same in one resolution. It can be found that in all span sections, the angle of attack is maximum at 0°azimuth angle and minimum at 180°azimuth angle. At the zero azimuth angle, the blade is in advancing process, leading to a higher magnitude of relative velocity and a lower angle of angle attack. On the other hand, at the 180°azimuth angle, the blade is in retreating process, leading to a lower magnitude of relative velocity and a higher angle of attack, shown in Fig. 20. Neglecting the change of pitch angle due to torsional deformation, the trend of angle of attack relative to azimuth angle should be identical as the inflow angle. Consequently, the angle of attack usually reaches the maximum and minimum at azimuth angles of 0° and 180°, respectively. Both the tangential and normal force coefficients variation function with the azimuth angle are the same with the local angle of attack.
The variations of Cn in one resolution at outer spans, i.e. 80% and 95% spanwise sections, are negligible. Cn at 47% span is largest, while the Cn at 95% span is smallest. At other three spans, Cn curves show slight fluctuations. With the increase of yaw angle, the variations of Cn at inner spans increase obviously. Comparing to non-yawed condition, the Cn increases when the azimuth angle is between 180°and 360°; it decreases when the azimuth angle is between 0°and 180°. Theoretically, the minimum Cn is at the azimuth angle of 180°. The Cn curves at outer span sections agree well with theoretically analysis. As discussed before, there is a large drop of Cn at around the azimuth angle of 90°for 30% and 47% span sections since the blade is just at downstream of the spinner. The variations of Ct shown in Fig. 22 are similar to that of Cn. The two figures show that aerodynamic load variation occurs at inner span of the blade under yaw, which has significant influence on the blade fatigue life. The largest load happened at 0°azimuth angle.

Fig. 22. Tangent force coefficient distribution at different azimuth angles under yaw
However, the azimuthal variation of aerodynamic force efficiency is a combined effect of change of angle of attack, relative velocity magnitude and orientation of velocity component tangential to rotor plane, even the three dimensional stall effect in the rotation periodic etc., the azimuthal variations of tangential and normal force efficiency can be different. Sant carried out the numerical simulation on Mexico wind turbine[6], a different azimuthal variation of aerodynamic loads were presented, where the lower magnitude of normal and tangent force coefficient can be observed in region where the blade is retreating toward the wind velocity component aligned tangent to the rotor disk plane(which are higher in current simulation). 
    Fig. 23 shows the radial distributions of Cn under nine yaw angles. With the increase of yaw angle, Cn at each span section decreases. The variation of Cn at blade root is obviously larger than that at blade tip. Under small yaw angles(0°,5°,10°), the maximum Cn is located at about 40% span section. With the yaw angle increasing, the maximum Cn moves from mid span to outer span. For azimuth angles from -45°to 45°, Cn decreases almost linearly from inner span to outer span since the radial component effect of inflow is rather small. While, for azimuth angles from 45◦ to 315◦, Cn increases first and then decreases gradually from inner span to outer span. When yaw angle is 30◦, the maximum Cn moves to about r/R=0.6, and at higher yaw angles, the maximum load keep at the r/R=0.7 stably. At low wind speed, the flow remains mostly attached to the blade surface, except that the small separation at the blade root. The radial flow is also not pronounced. So, the normal force coefficient varying along the blade spanwise are mainly due to the effect of yaw, which leads to the variation of the angle of attack with the azimuth angle at the local airfoil section.

3.2.3 Three dimensional stall effect
Under yawed conditions, more obvious unsteady effect can be observed due to three-dimensional stall. Fig. 24 shows the normal force coefficient distribution respecting the angle of attack in on revolution under different yaw angles. The abscissa is the angle of attack. For non-yawed condition, the angle of attack and the force coefficients have almost no variations. Thus, they are shown as points in Fig. 24 a). With the yaw angle increasing, unsteady effect occurs firstly at inner span sections, for instance the r/R=0.3 span section shown in Fig. 24). The red dashed arrow line shows the resolution process with the azimuth angle from 0°to 360°. The label 1 indicates the 0° azimuth angle, i.e. the starting point of the resolution. Cn and the angle of attack show obvious difference during one revolution, forming a circle. With the increasing of yaw angle, the variations of aerodynamic coefficients become much stronger, the range of the circle increases fast. However, when yaw angle become 30°, seen from Fig. 24), the circle distribution of Cn crossed, and become inversed. The same variation law can be applied to the 60°yaw angle.

Conclusions
The paper performed unsteady numerical simulations to investigate the static aerodynamic performances of a HAWT under yaw. The numerical simulation results with T-SST turbulent model show good agreement with measurement data. The conclusions are summarized below:
With the increase of the yaw angle, the azimuth angle of the rotor minimum loading around the first periodic become bigger. The yaw effect leads to a prominent increase of the amplitudes of torque in the low frequency range. The maximum time-averaged load varies with the increase of yaw angle, moving away from 40% to 70% of radial position. The blade transient loading of azimuth angles between -45◦ to 45◦ is almost monotonically decreased, while the value between 45◦ to 315◦ increases firstly, then decreases. Three dimensional effect of stall presents obvious load fluctuations at the inner board of blade, and becomes stronger with the increase of yaw angle. The fluctuated loading become more prominent in the retreating side than that of the advancing side.
